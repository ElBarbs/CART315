## Enter the Gungeon - Game Analysis

### Mechanics

  - 1410 synergies possible between guns and items.
  - 5 shooting types for guns:
    - Automatic
    - Semi-automatic

- Some items will increase your curse stat, which makes the enemies stronger in exchange for better loot.
- Ammo crates only refill one of your guns, so you have to choose which wisely.
- Incremental unlocks for new characters, guns, items, NPCs, etc.
- The layout of the different floors are randomly generated at the start of each run.
  - Teleporters are available to move between rooms on the same floor.
  - Each floor has an alternate secret version, which is harder but has better loot.
  - Each floor, you get a limited number of “blanks” that can be used to clear all bullets on the screen.
- An elevator can be unlocked and upgraded to skip the first floors when starting a new run.
- Special reward when killing the boss of a floor without taking damage.
