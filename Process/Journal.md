## Game Analysis
### Enter the Gungeon
#### Mechanics
- Lots of different guns (243) and passive/active items (271).
    - 1410 synergies possible between guns and items.
    - 5 shooting types for guns:
        - Automatic
        - Semi-automatic
        - Charged
        - Beam
        - Burst
- Some items will increase your curse stat, which makes the enemies stronger in exchange for better loot.
- Ammo crates only refill one of your guns, so you have to choose which wisely.
- Incremental unlocks for new characters, guns, items, NPCs, etc.
- The layout of the different floors are randomly generated at the start of each run.
    - Teleporters are available to move between rooms on the same floor.
    - Each floor has an alternate secret version, which is harder but has better loot.
    - Each floor, you get a limited number of “blanks” that can be used to clear all bullets on the screen.
- An elevator can be unlocked and upgraded to skip the first floors when starting a new run.
- Special reward when killing the boss of a floor without taking damage.
#### Ideas for Future Projects
- Synergies between items.
- Limited quantity of ammo.
- Teleporters.
- Different shooting types.
- "Curse" stat.
